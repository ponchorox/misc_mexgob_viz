# misc_mexgob_viz
A collection of data visualization from official reports from México's government sites. Altough some data from the site has some nice visualizations such as the ones pertaining COVID-19, there are some more obscure interesting reports with no visualization at all. If you would like me to create an additional visualization please request it in the Issues github section along with the links where the data can be obtained.

### Illegal landfills in CDMX

A visualization of illegal landfills in México City using geographical coordinates obtained from datos.cdmx.gob.mx although, according to the data log the file was uploaded in January 23 2021 but the file title states it's from 2017, seeing the size of the data and the expected recurrence of illegal landfills I assume this data is from a single report from 2017 that was later uploaded on 2021.
